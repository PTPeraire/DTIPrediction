Supplementary data for _Using bioactivity signatures to predict drug-target interactions_.

Here we find, the raw ChEMBL data for the time-split mentioned in Torren-Peraire et al., for both the compound-based and target-based method. Also included is the relevant results for each methods. For compound-based we show the rank of the true interactions tested, for the target-based method the validation output of the novel targets. 

Futhermore, included is a guided notebook detailing the implementation of the compound-based method. A similar notebook will be implemented for the target-based method in due course.
